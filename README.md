# Depop-Refresh-Extension
Simple Depop Refresh Chrome Extension

This extension is a work in progress.

To install go to chrome://extensions/ on chrome and click Load Unpacked. Once that is done go to depop and make sure to be logged in. The tool works by using Depop's cookies and has no access to usernames or passwords.

To use choose how often to wait between each individual item to refresh change the individual item refresh speed. To choose how often to start the refresh change the refresh speed. After choosing those settings click refresh and a picture of the item being refreshed and the amount of items left to refresh will show. After it is done it will show time remaining. The popup must stay open to work correctly.
